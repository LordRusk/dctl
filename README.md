# WORK IN PROGRESS
This project is in extreme alpha stages, barely any interactions with discord are available because I'm still heavily working on the backend.

## Plans
I want this project to be an easy to use // script-able program for doing various (unusual-)tasks.

## Where are we at?
Currently the `ui` system is pretty set in stone, the logger is finished, the handler package has been written and tested, but not implemented. I've implemented the `-d` option for list selections being done through [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu).

### other
This project has taught me a lot, and will continue to teach me more and more. I'm only uploading this because I might move from Arch to Void. Wish me luck!
