# WORK IN PROGRESS
This project is in extreme alpha stages, barely any interactions with discord are available because I'm still heavily working on the backend.

## Plans
I want this project to be an easy to use // script-able program for doing various (unusual-)tasks.

## Where are we at?
`-d` option for list selections being done through [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu) - backend for this is a portable api for integrating arbitrary menu programs into Go projects. This is either dead in the water, or I'll continue slowly fixing and adding more. Maybe the next step is to move to arikawa/v3, who knows.
